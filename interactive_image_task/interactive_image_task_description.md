# Interactive Image Task (AP Computer Science Principles - Fall 2023)

**TASK:** Using CMU Graphics / Python, code an interactive image.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

* Your interactive image must be personalized.
* Your interactive image must contain the following interactive elements:
    * When you click the mouse *(possibly in a specific location)*, something in your image changes.
    * When you release the mouse *(possibly in a specific location)*, something in your image changes.
* Your image must contain the following code elements:
    * At least one variable.
    * At least one use of properties.
    * At least one function.
    * At least one conditional.
    * At least one use of incrementation (e.g. a counter, the x- or y- position of a shape, the size of a shape, etc.)
* Be creative!

## Part 1

Plan your interactive image.  In planning, consider the following prompts:
* Overall, what will your image be?  In what way(s) will you personalize it?
* Describe one specific way in which clicking the mouse *(possibly in a specific location)* will make something in your image change.
* Describe one specific way in which releasing the mouse *(possibly in a specific location)* will make something in your image change.
* Describe one way in which you will use a conditional *(i.e. if statement)* to implement your interactive image.
* Describe one way in which you will use use incrementation/decrementation *(i.e. +=)* to implement your interactive image.

**TO SHARE PART 1 OF THIS TASK:**
* Navigate to your Github Portfolio.
* Click Add File > Create New File.
* Title your file "LastNameFirstInitial_InteractiveImageTask_Description.md"
* Using markdown, code your responses to the prompts above.
* Commit your file. **Remember to include an appropriate commit note.**

## Part 2

Code your interactive image.

As you code, remember to...

* Write and save your code on your virtual environment using the file name: "LastNameFirstInitial_InteractiveImageTask_Code".
* Regularly seek feedback from your colleagues.
* Regularly commit your work to your GitHub portfolio.  For each commit:
    * Include a brief commit note describing the progress you have made.
    * Include an extended description that addresses the following three questions:
        * What specific progress have you made?
        * What bugs (if any) have you fixed?
        * What are the specific next steps you plan to work on? 

## Part 3

After you have completed your interactive image, write a reflection that addresses the following prompts:

* Describe the interactive image task.  What is the purpose of the interactive image you created?
* How did your work on the interactive image task contribute to your overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
* In what ways did you iteratively develop your interactive image over time?
* Looking back, what might you have done differently?
* If you were to further develop your interactive image, what would your next steps be?
  
**TO SHARE PART 3 OF THIS TASK:**
* Navigate to your Github Portfolio.
* Click Add File > Create New File.
* Title your file "LastNameFirstInitial_InteractiveImageTask_Reflection.md"
* Using markdown, code your responses to the prompts above.
* Commit your file. **Remember to include an appropriate commit note.**
