# Pixelated Pic Project (AP Computer Science Principles - Fall 2023)

**TASK:** Use what you have learned about binary numbers to code a pixelated pic.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

* Your pixelated pic must include be fill an 8 pixel x 8 pixel grid.
* Your pixelated pic must include at least 10 different colored pixels.
* Be creative!

## Part 1

On the grid provided in class, create a pixelated pic by coloring in each square with a single color.

**TO SHARE PART 1 OF THIS TASK:**
* Capture an image of your pixelated pic and save it to your virtual environment using the filename: "LastNameFirstInitial_PixelatedPicProject_Sketch.tif".
* Navigate to your Github Portfolio and upload your image (Add File > Upload File)
* Commit your image. **Remember to include an appropriate commit note.**

## Part 2

Using the template provided on Teams, recreate your pixelated pic using RGB triplets and color screen captures from the Google Color Picker.

**TO SHARE PART 2 OF THIS TASK:**
* Convert your word document to a pdf and save it to your virtual environment using the filename: "LastNameFirstInitial_PixelatedPicProject_RGBTriplets.pdf".
* Navigate to your Github Portfolio and upload your file (Add File > Upload File)
* Commit your file. **Remember to include an appropriate commit note.**

## Part 3

Convert your pixelated pic to a binary sequence.

* First, use the graphic organizer provided in class to convert each pixel in your pixelated pic to a binary sequence. Remember to show all work.

  **Note: For each pixel, this sequence should be 24 bits long: 8 bits for red, 8 bits for green, and 8 bits for blue.<br>**

* Next, in a word document, concatenate the binary sequences for each pixel to form one long binary sequence.

  **Note: This sequence should be 1536 bits long (64 sequences x 24 bits each).<br><br>**
  **PRO TIP: Use copy/paste strategically.<br><br>**

**TO SHARE PART 3 OF THIS TASK:**
* Convert your word document to a pdf using the filename: "LastNameFirstInitial_PixelatedPicProject_BinarySequence.pdf".
* Scan and save your graphic organizer (including all of your work) to a pdf using the filename: "LastNameFirstInitial_PixelatedPicProject_BinaryConverstionWork.pdf".
* Navigate to your Github Portfolio and upload both files (Add File > Upload File)
* Commit both files. **Remember to include appropriate commit notes.**

## Part 4

Generate a digital image of your pixelated pic.

* Download the pixelated_pic_project_file_builder to your virtual environment.
* Run the pixelated_pic_project_file_builder.
* Follow the directions in the file builder to generate and view a digital image of your pixelated pic.

**TO SHARE PART 4 OF THIS TASK:**
* Rename the digital version of your pixelated pic by appending "LastNameFirstInitial_" to the beginning of the filename.
* Navigate to your Github Portfolio and upload the digital version of your pixelated pic. (Add File > Upload File)
* Commit your file. **Remember to include an appropriate commit note.**
