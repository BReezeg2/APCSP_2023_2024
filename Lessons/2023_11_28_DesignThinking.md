### **Design Thinking**

**AIM:** In what ways can we apply design thinking to iteratively develop our work?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS61T.3</ins>: Code using appropriate **programming logic**.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate **syntax**.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.6</ins>: Engage in the **design thinking** process to iteratively develop your work.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I can explain what the design thinking process is.
    - [ ] I can name the specific steps of the design thinking process.
    - [ ] I can justify why each step of the design thinking process is important.
    - [ ] I can describe how the steps of the design thinking process relate to each other.
    - [ ] I can articulate how computer scientists use the design thinking process to iteratively develop their work.
    - [ ] I can explain specifically how I am using the design thinking process iteratively develop my work on the emoji project.
- [ ] My work shows evidence of engagement in the design thinking process.
    - [ ] The version history of my emoji task code on GitHub shows several iteratively developed versions.
    - [ ] Each version has thorough commit notes including:
        - [ ] Updates
        - [ ] Bug Fixes
        - [ ] Next Steps.

**DO NOW:**  

1. Check out this video about design thinking:
   <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r0VX-aU_T8
3. In your terrific trios (or dynamic duos) summarize your understanding of design thinking based on the video you watched.
4. Write down your summary and be prepared to share.

   
**AGENDA:**  

* Initial design thinking summaries.
* The design thinking process. (interactive lecture)
* Practice: Applying the design thinking process to our emoji tasks. 
* Summary / Share: Revised design thinking summaries.

**HOMEWORK:** Continue working on your emoji project.

<BR><BR>**The Design Thinking Process**
| Step | Description | 
|---|---|
|Empathize| <li>Determine what people really care about.|
|Define the Problem| <li>Formulate a problem statement.<br><li>Establish specific goals.|
|Ideate|<li>Brainstorm ideas to solve the problem.<br><li>Don't get caught up trying to come up with one perfect idea.<br><li>Instead, come up with many ideas.<br><li> Be creative! 
|Prototype|<li>Build a solution (physically, digitally, etc.) that is good enough to be tested.|
|Test|<li> Test your prototype with actual users.<br><li>Get Feedback!|
