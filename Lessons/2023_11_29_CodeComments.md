### **Code Comments**

**AIM:** In what ways can leverage code comments to document our work?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS61T.3</ins>: Code using appropriate **programming logic**.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate **syntax**.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.5</ins>: **Communicate** effectively as a computer scientist.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I can describe what code comments are.
- [ ] I can describe who code comments are for.
    - [ ] I describe three different ways that code comments support me as the coder.
    - [ ] I can describe how code comments support other coders.
    - [ ] I can describe how code comments support users. develop my work on the emoji project.
- [ ] I can describe best practices for commenting code.
- [ ] My work demonstrates that I am effectively using code comments to document my work.
    - [ ] My work has code comments.
    - [ ] My code comments are aligned to best practices for commenting code.

**DO NOW:**  

1. In writing...
   * Describe what your emoji looks like.
   * Describe some of the code you are writing to display your emoji.
2. In your terrific trios (or dynamic duos) share your responses with each other.
3. Be prepared to share out what your partners shared with you.
   
**AGENDA:**  

* Project descriptions.
* Direct instruction (interactive lecture)
    * What are code comments?
    * Who are code comments for?
    * What are best practices for writing code comments?
* Practice: Incorporating code comments into our emoji tasks. 
* Summary / Share: Code comment share out.

**HOMEWORK:** Continue working on your emoji project.  By now your code should have a minimum of three versions (possibly more): 
* Your initial draft
* At least one (possibly more) iteration(s) before code comments.
* At least one (possibly more) iteration(s) that include code comments.

**REFERENCE:**
<BR><BR>**Who are code comments for?**
| Step | Description | 
|---|---|
|Ourselves<br>(Before we code)| Comments allow us to plan subgoals (smaller goals) for the larger programs we are developing.  By writing sub-goal label comments, we can outline our plan.  Eventually, our sub-goal label comments become the documentation for our program.|
|Ourselves<br>(As we code)| Comments allow us to leave notes to ourself as we code to help us keep track of our progress, next steps, etc.|
|Ourselves<br>(After we have coded)|Comments can help us understand our own code, especially if we haven't looked at it in a while.  This is particularly important if we plan to revise a program we wrote or if we plan to use a coding strategy from one project in a new project.  Code comments help us make sense of our own thinking process. | 
|Other coders|Comments also help other coders understand our thinking process.  Program development is often a collaborative process.  By helping other coders understand our thinking, it is easier for a group of coders to collaborate on developing a program.|
|Users|Comments also help users understand our thinking process.  They help interested users make sense of what is going on "behind the scenes".|

**Code Commenting Best Practices**:
* Make comments meaningful (don't just duplicate the code itself).
* Use clear and concise language (It is also important to use proper grammar and punctuation).
* Don't undercomment (A single comment describing your entire program is insufficient).
* Don't overcomment (It is unnecessray to write an individual comment for every single line of code).
* Group comments in a meaningful way (For example, in your emoji project, if a group of commands are used to generate a background, create one comment for that group).
* Be consistent in the way you comment.
* Include citations (including links) when relevant (**This is especially important if you are using others' intellectual property.  You must cite it.  Also, don't use it unless you have written permission to do so**).
* Write sub-goal comments as you code (Don't wait until you are done coding).
