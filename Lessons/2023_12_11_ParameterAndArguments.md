### **Parameters and Arguments**

**AIM:** In what ways can we use parameters and arguments to write functions that better manage the complexity of our programs?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS61T.2</ins>: Apply **computational thinking** skills to a variety of tasks.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61T.3</ins> Code using appropriate **programming logic**.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate **syntax**.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I am to articulate what parameters and arguments are, what specific roles they serve, and how they relate to each other.
- [ ] I am able to accurately use parameters in the bodies of functions.
- [ ] I am able to accurately use arguments in function calls.
- [ ] I am able to leverage the testing process to assess whether or not a function I have written is behaving in the way I expect it to.
