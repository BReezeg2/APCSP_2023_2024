### **Emoji Task Reflection / Technical Assessment / Professional Computer Science Portfolio**

**AIM:** In what ways can I leverage reflecting on my own work as a strategy for deepening my learning while simultaneously building my professional computer science portfolio?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61T.5</ins>: **Communicate** effectively as a computer scientist.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.8</ins>: Model **employability skills** such as personal mindset, planning for success, and collaboration.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I am able name the three parts of the technical assessment I must take as a Computer Science major at Inwood Early College.
- [ ] I am able to describe what my professional computer science portfolio is as well as its role in relation to expanding my access to college and career opportunities.
- [ ] I am able to produce a reflection for the emoji project that meets the expectations to be included in my professional computer science portfolio.

**DO NOW:**  

1. <A HREF="https://github.com/MrSwotinsky/APCSP_2023_2024/blob/main/IEC%20-%20CTE%20CS%20Pathway%20-%20Technical%20Assessment.pdf">Click here</A> to open the description of the <A HREF="https://github.com/MrSwotinsky/APCSP_2023_2024/blob/main/IEC%20-%20CTE%20CS%20Pathway%20-%20Technical%20Assessment.pdf">Inwood Early College - Computer Science major technical assessment</A>
2. Spend 5 minutes quickly reading about parts 1, 2, and 3 of the technical assessment.
3. Pay particularly close attention to the secions on page 2 about **Artifacts of Learning** and **Reflections**
4. Write down at least one thing you learned about the technical assessment.
5. Write down at least one question you have about the technical assessment.
6. Be prepared to share out what you wrote down.
   
**AGENDA:**  

* Inwood Early College Computer Science major technical assessment review.
* Project reflection expectations.
* Emoji Task work time.
* Summary / Share: Progress and Next Steps

**HOMEWORK:** Continue working on your emoji project, and begin writing your reflection.  Your reflection should be written in markdown, and uploaded to your portfolio using the following filename:<br>`LastNameFirstInitial_EmojiTask_Reflection.md`

**Remember: Your final project is due this Friday, December 8th 2023**

**Reflection Expectations:**

* How would you describe this artifact, and what is its purpose?
* In what ways did this artifact contribute to your overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
* How has this artifact been iteratively developed over time? (include specific examples)
* Looking back, what might you have done differently?
* If you were to further develop this artifact, what would your next steps be?

**Professional Computer Science Portfolio - Excerpts from Rubric:**

**Artifact from AP CSP 1 or 2:**

|Mastery|Proficiency|Developing|Limited|Not Yet Beginning|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Demonstrates mastery of technical skills aligned to AP CSP 1 or 2.|Demonstrates proficiency of technical skills aligned to AP CSP 1 or 2.|Demonstrates developing understanding of technical skills aligned to AP CSP 1 or 2.|Demonstrates limited understanding of technical skills aligned to AP CSP 1 or 2.|Does not demonstrate understanding of technical skills aligned to AP CSP 1 or 2.|

**Reflections:**

|Mastery|Proficiency|Developing|Limited|Not Yet Beginning|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Thoughtful written reflections for every artifact that describe how each contributed to the overall learning experience as a Computer Science major, as well as how each was iteratively developed over time, what might have been done differently, and next steps for further development|Written reflections for most artifacts that describe how each contributed to the overall learning experience as a Computer Science major, as well as how each was iteratively developed over time.|Written reflections for some artifacts that describe how each contributed to the overall learning experience as a Computer Science major.| Written reflections some artifacts that make reference to overall learning experience as a Computer Science major.|No written reflections OR Written reflections make no reference to overall learning experience as a Computer Science major.|
