### **Synthesizing CMU Graphics Coding Skills, Design Thinking, and Code Comments**

**AIM:** In what ways can synthesis what we have learned about coding in CMU graphics, the design thinking process, and code comments, to complete our emoji projects?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS61T.3</ins>: Code using appropriate **programming logic**.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.4</ins>: Code using appropriate **syntax**.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.5</ins>: **Communicate** effectively as a computer scientist.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.6</ins>: Engage in the **Design Thinking** process to iteratively develop your work.
<BR><ins>IEC.TYS61T.8</ins>: Model **employability skills** such as personal mindset, planning for success, and collaboration.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I am able to write Python Code in CMU graphics using appropriate programming logic and syntax to generate a digital image of my emoji.
- [ ] I am able to document my work by writing comments that are aligned to best practices.
- [ ] I am actively engaged in the design thinking process.
    - [ ] I am developing new iterations of my emoji.
    - [ ] I am seeking and using feedback from peers to develop each iteration of my emoji.
    - [ ] I am uploading each iteration of my emoji to my GitHub portfolio, and including an appropriate commit note and description for each version.
         
- [ ] I am able to apply the work I have been doing in class to complete my project outside of class time.

**DO NOW:**  

1. In writing...
   * Describe best practices for commenting code.
   * Describe the design thinking process.
   * Describe expectations for uploading progress to your GitHub portfolio.
2. In your terrific trios (or dynamic duos) share your responses with each other.
3. Be prepared to share out what your partners shared with you.
   
**AGENDA:**  

* Do Now Review
* Project Next Steps & Expectations
* Emoji Task Work Time
* Summary / Share: Problems & Solutions

**HOMEWORK:** Continue working on your emoji project, synthesising everyone you have learned about coding in CMU graphics, the design thinking process, and code commenting.  

**Remember: Your final project is due next Friday, December 8th 2023**
